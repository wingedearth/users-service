## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Users Service
├── REST API (Express + TypeScript)
├── Data Layer (MongoDB + Mongoose)
├── Validation Layer (Schema validation)
├── Error Handling (Centralized)
└── Health Monitoring (Status endpoint)
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Service health check |
| GET | `/api/users` | List all users |
| GET | `/api/users/:id` | Get user by ID |
| POST | `/api/users` | Create new user |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | Update user |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Delete user |

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Database
npm run db:up              # Start MongoDB
npm run db:admin           # Start admin interface

# Development  
npm run dev                # Start development server
npm run test:api           # Test all endpoints

# Commits & Releases
npm run commit             # Interactive commit
npm run release            # Create new release
```

## 🎯 Ready for Integration

This service is now ready to be integrated into a larger microservices architecture:

- **GraphQL Gateway** - Can consume this REST API
- **Authentication Service** - Can be added as middleware
- **Other Services** - Can follow this same pattern
- **API Gateway** - Can route requests to this service
- **Monitoring** - Health endpoint ready for monitoring tools

## 📈 Changelog Integration

Every commit following conventional commit format automatically:
- ✅ Updates the changelog
- ✅ Bumps the version number  
- ✅ Creates git tags
- ✅ Links to GitHub commits
- ✅ Groups changes by type (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** to the codebase
2. **Test locally** with `npm run dev` and `npm run test:api`
3. **Commit** with `npm run commit` (guided process)
4. **Release** with `npm run release` (automated versioning)
5. **Push** with `git push --follow-tags origin main`

## 📝 What's Next?

The foundation is solid. Future enhancements could include:
- JWT Authentication
- Request validation (Joi/Zod)
- Unit/integration tests
- Rate limiting
- Pagination
- Search & filtering
- Containerization
- CI/CD pipeline
